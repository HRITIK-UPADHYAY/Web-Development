This application allows users to create, format, and manage spreadsheets with features like bold, italics, underlined text, and text alignment options (center, right, left). Users can also upload and download spreadsheet files. The project highlights my proficiency in front-end web development and UI/UX design, showcasing my ability to create user-friendly and functional web applications.I created a YouTube clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the YouTube Google Console API key to fetch data from YouTube. This project aims to replicate the core features and functionalities of YouTube, allowing users to search and view videos. The API integration ensures that the clone can retrieve real-time video data from YouTube."
